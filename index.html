    <p>Hi! My name is Amanda Vu. I am a student in the Interactive Media Design program. I chose this program because I enjoy designing digitally and because I have interests in UI/UX. In my spare time, I enjoy designing various types of things ranging from posters, logos, wallpapers, etc. For painting, I enjoy using watercolours and I usually like to paint scenery, buildings and nature.</p>

        <p>By the end of this program, I hope to learn various skills from the courses in the IMD program, and to have a diverse portfolio that will help me stand out in the design field after graduating. </p>
